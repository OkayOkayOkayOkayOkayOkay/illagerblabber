## What is this monstrosity?

IllagerBlabber adds totally necessary, definitely-not-annoying professional voice lines to all illagers. 
Now when a pillager is about to murder you, he'll let you know with a charming one-liner!

Ever wondered what Vindicators say before chopping you in half? No? **WELL NOW YOU'LL KNOW ANYWAY.**

### Currently more than 300 voice lines!
All the voice lines are vanilla friendly, essentially mimicking their Vanilla voices!!

##  üó£Ô∏è Features That Actually Required Brain Cells to make üó£Ô∏è

### Advanced Audio System

Each illager has their own vocal personality - Pillagers sound like retail workers on their fifth straight closing shift, Vindicators sound like they're perpetually stepping on Legos, and Evokers speak like they're judging your Minecraft build while sipping expensive tea.

- **Context-aware dialogue system (different lines when):**
    - Passive
    - Spotting a player or any target for the first time
    - Being mid-battle
    - Getting hurt
    - Celebrating a kill (rude!) or target runs away

### Smart Sound Management
- Dynamic cooldown system that scales based on illager density
    - No more audio hell when fighting raids!
    - The more illagers (of one type) present, the less frequently each one speaks to prevent audio spam
    - Mathematical formula ensuring optimal audio experience ~~_(trust me bro)_~~

### Cool stuffs
- Minimal performance impact
- Fully client side
- VERY lively illagers!

## üó£Ô∏è Use alongside [Sound Physics Remastered](https://modrinth.com/mod/sound-physics-remastered) for maximum immersion!

## Future Plans

- More illager types (looking at you, Illusioner)
- Doubling the Voice lines!!
- Therapy for players traumatized by illager voices
- **VillagerBlabber!** üó£Ô∏è
